Imbalanced data refers to datasets where the target class has an uneven distribution of observations, i.e., one class label has a very high number of observations, and the other has a deficient number of observations.

For the dataset problem 1, it was noticed to have a major imbalance of the target class, skewed towards the target value 0. The valuex counts showed that 9900 rows were of target 0 and only 100 rows were of target 1.

There are many resampling techniques to address imbalanced data. For this challenge, I explored Oversampling and SMOTE.

Oversampling is the process of generating synthetic data that tries to randomly generate a sample of the attributes from observations in the minority class. There are a number of methods used to oversample a dataset for a typical classification problem. The most common technique is called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). In simple terms, it looks at the feature space for the minority class data points and considers its k nearest neighbours.

In contrast to other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and specialized algorithms Balanced Bagging Classifier offers a strong combination of resampling and ensemble learning.

For train/test split, I used the standard 80/20 split for training and testing.

Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to evaluate the performance of models on imbalanced data. Additionally, metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) can also be used. 

Conclusion: To overcome imbalanced dataset challenges, various techniques can be employed, including proper selection of evaluation metrics, resampling methods like oversampling and undersampling, utilizing algorithms designed for imbalance such as SMOTE, employing ensemble methods like BalancedBaggingClassifier. Each technique offers unique advantages and may be more suitable depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand.
